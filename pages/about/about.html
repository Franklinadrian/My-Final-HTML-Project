  <h1> About us</h1><centre><h2> Franklin Azodo </h2></centre>
  <p> My name is Franklin Azodo. I am 17 of age . I grew up in Lagos state in Nigeria
    . I am a Otaku fan or weeb also known as an Anime freak. I usually read Story of Mythology when i am bored to pass the time. I am planning on studing computer science in the University . I mostly spend my days with Family and occasionally friends. I am a Huge Marvel fan finding the script writing and storyline more in order and scientific than to dc, But i must admit i also enjoy watching dc cause the deal with fantasy and magic so i will say its a fifty-fifty from my own point of view. I grew up in a simple home but i can say there nothing simple about me. With someone whose fascinated my the dark art, witchcraft and gods history , i have been called a got somethings but never quite found it offensive. Well thats all for now. <b>THANK YOU</b>
